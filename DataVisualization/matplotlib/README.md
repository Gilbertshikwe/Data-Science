# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This project demonstrates basic data visualization techniques using Matplotlib, a popular plotting library in Python. The script `mat.py` includes examples of various types of plots with realistic datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

## Plot Examples

The `mat.py` script includes the following plot types:

1. **Line Plot**: Demonstrates how to plot a simple line chart, using average temperature data over a week.
2. **Customized Line Plot**: Shows how to customize line plots with different styles and markers, using sales data over two weeks.
3. **Bar Plot**: Illustrates a bar chart, using the number of products sold in different categories.
4. **Scatter Plot**: Displays a scatter plot, using height and weight data of individuals.
5. **Histogram**: Shows a histogram, using the distribution of exam scores.
6. **Pie Chart**: Demonstrates a pie chart, using market share data of different companies.

## Running the Script

To run the script and display the plots, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python mat.py
```

Each plot will be displayed one by one. Close each plot window to proceed to the next plot.

## Customizing the Plots

You can customize the plots by modifying the corresponding functions in `mat.py`. Each function is designed to be easily understandable and adaptable to different datasets and requirements.
