# Central Tendency Measures in Statistics

Central tendency is a statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire dataset. The most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. This README covers different types of mean and central tendency calculations for both ungrouped and grouped data.

## Types of Mean in Python

The mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the central or typical value of a dataset. There are different types of mean, each with its own formula and characteristics. Here, we will explore three types of mean: arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean, along with their Python implementations.

### 1. Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean (or simply mean) is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values.

**Formula**:

```
Arithmetic Mean = (Σ x_i) / n
```

Where `Σ x_i` is the sum of all values, and `n` is the number of values.

**Python Code**:

```python
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
arithmetic_mean = np.mean(data)
print(f"Arithmetic Mean: {arithmetic_mean}")
```

**Explanation**: For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the arithmetic mean is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the sum of all values: `2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30`
2. Count the number of values: `n = 5`
3. Divide the sum by the number of values: `Arithmetic Mean = 30 / 5 = 6`

In the Python code, we use the `np.mean()` function from NumPy to calculate the arithmetic mean of the provided dataset.

### 2. Geometric Mean

The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of all values, where `n` is the number of values. It is often used when dealing with percentages, ratios, or growth rates.

**Formula**:

```
Geometric Mean = (∏ x_i)^(1/n)
```

Where `∏ x_i` is the product of all values, and `n` is the number of values.

**Python Code**:

```python
from scipy.stats import gmean

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
geometric_mean = gmean(data)
print(f"Geometric Mean: {geometric_mean}")
```

**Explanation**: For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the geometric mean is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the product of all values: `2 × 4 × 6 × 8 × 10 = 3840`
2. Count the number of values: `n = 5`
3. Take the nth root of the product: `Geometric Mean = (3840)^(1/5) ≈ 5.52`

In the Python code, we use the `gmean()` function from the `scipy.stats` module to calculate the geometric mean of the provided dataset.

### 3. Harmonic Mean

The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values. It is often used when dealing with rates or ratios, and it is particularly useful when averaging quantities whose reciprocals are more meaningful than the quantities themselves (e.g., speeds).

**Formula**:

```
Harmonic Mean = n / (Σ (1/x_i))
```

Where `n` is the number of values, and `x_i` are the values.

**Python Code**:

```python
from scipy.stats import hmean

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
harmonic_mean = hmean(data)
print(f"Harmonic Mean: {harmonic_mean}")
```

**Explanation**: For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the harmonic mean is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the reciprocals of the values: `1/2, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10`
2. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals: `(1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/10) / 5 = 0.3`
3. Take the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals: `Harmonic Mean = 1 / 0.3 ≈ 3.33`

In the Python code, we use the `hmean()` function from the `scipy.stats` module to calculate the harmonic mean of the provided dataset.

These different types of mean are useful in various situations, depending on the characteristics of the data and the specific problem being addressed. The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used, while the geometric and harmonic means are often employed in specific scenarios where they provide more meaningful or appropriate representations of the central tendency.

## Ungrouped Data

Ungrouped data is raw data that has not been organized into groups. Measures of central tendency for ungrouped data can be directly calculated using the data values.

**Example for Mean, Median, and Mode**:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 6]
mean = np.mean(data)
median = np.median(data)
mode = stats.mode(data).mode[0]

print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Median: {median}")
print(f"Mode: {mode}")
```

## Grouped Data

Grouped data is data that has been organized into frequency distribution tables. Measures of central tendency for grouped data are calculated using the class intervals and their frequencies.

**Example for Grouped Data**:

Suppose we have the following frequency distribution table:

| Class Interval | Frequency |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 0-10           | 2         |
| 10-20          | 3         |
| 20-30          | 5         |
| 30-40          | 4         |
| 40-50          | 1         |

We can calculate the mean, median, and mode for grouped data.

**Mean (Grouped Data)**

**Formula**:

```
Mean = (∑ (f_i · x_i)) / (∑ f_i)
```

Where `f_i` is the frequency of the class interval, and `x_i` is the midpoint of the class interval.

**Median (Grouped Data)**

**Formula**:

```
Median = L + ((N/2 - CF) / f) × h
```

Where:
- `L` is the lower boundary of the median class
- `N` is the total number of observations
- `CF` is the cumulative frequency of the class before the median class
- `f` is the frequency of the median class
- `h` is the class interval size

**Mode (Grouped Data)**

**Formula**:

```
Mode = L + ((f_1 - f_0) / (2f_1 - f_0 - f_2)) × h
```

Where:
- `L` is the lower boundary of the modal class
- `f_1` is the frequency of the modal class
- `f_0` is the frequency of the class before the modal class
- `f_2` is the frequency of the class after the modal class
- `h` is the class interval size

```python
# Example data
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 6]
mean, median, mode = ungrouped_data_central_tendency(data)
print(f"Ungrouped Data - Mean: {mean}, Median: {median}, Mode: {mode}")

class_intervals = [(0, 10), (10, 20), (20, 30), (30, 40), (40, 50)]
frequencies = [2, 3, 5, 4, 1]
mean_grouped, median_grouped, mode_grouped = grouped_data_central_tendency(class_intervals, frequencies)
print(f"Grouped Data - Mean: {mean_grouped}, Median: {median_grouped}, Mode: {mode_grouped}")
```

The functions `ungrouped_data_central_tendency` and `grouped_data_central_tendency` are not provided in the given code, but they should implement the formulas and calculations for the respective types of data.
# Measures of Variability in Statistics

Measures of variability (or dispersion) in statistics quantify the extent to which data points in a dataset differ from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). They provide insights into the spread, distribution, and consistency of the data. This README explores common measures of variability and shows how to calculate them using Python.

## 1. Range

The range is the simplest measure of variability and is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

**Formula:**
```
Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value
```

**Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
range_value = np.ptp(data)
print(f"Range: {range_value}")
```

**Explanation:**
For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the range is calculated as follows:
1. Find the maximum value: `max(data) = 10`
2. Find the minimum value: `min(data) = 2`
3. Calculate the range: `Range = max(data) - min(data) = 10 - 2 = 8`

In the Python code, we use the `np.ptp()` function from NumPy, which calculates the range (peak-to-peak) of the provided dataset. It internally finds the maximum and minimum values and returns their difference.

## 2. Interquartile Range (IQR)

The interquartile range (IQR) measures the range within which the central 50% of values fall. It is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).

**Formula:**
```
IQR = Q3 - Q1
```

**Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
q1 = np.percentile(data, 25)
q3 = np.percentile(data, 75)
iqr = q3 - q1
print(f"Interquartile Range (IQR): {iqr}")
```

**Explanation:**
For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the IQR is calculated as follows:
1. Sort the data in ascending order: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
2. Find the first quartile (Q1), which is the 25th percentile: `Q1 = np.percentile(data, 25) = 4`
3. Find the third quartile (Q3), which is the 75th percentile: `Q3 = np.percentile(data, 75) = 8`
4. Calculate the IQR: `IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 8 - 4 = 4`

In the Python code, we use the `np.percentile()` function from NumPy to calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles, which correspond to the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3), respectively. Then, we calculate the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.

## 3. Variance

Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a measure of the spread of the data points. The variance is calculated differently for populations and samples.

**Formula for Population Variance:**
```
Variance(σ²) = Σ(x_i - μ)² / N
```

**Formula for Sample Variance:**
```
Variance(s²) = Σ(x_i - x̄)² / (n - 1)
```

where `x_i` are the data points, `μ` is the population mean, `x̄` is the sample mean, `N` is the population size, and `n` is the sample size.

The sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, and it is commonly used when working with samples.

**Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
variance = np.var(data, ddof=1)  # ddof=1 for sample variance
print(f"Variance: {variance}")
```

**Explanation:**
For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the sample variance is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the mean: `mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 6`
2. Calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean: `[2 - 6, 4 - 6, 6 - 6, 8 - 6, 10 - 6] = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]`
3. Square each deviation: `[-4², -2², 0², 2², 4²] = [16, 4, 0, 4, 16]`
4. Sum the squared deviations: `16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 40`
5. Divide the sum of squared deviations by (n - 1), where n is the sample size: `Variance = 40 / (5 - 1) = 40 / 4 = 10`

In the Python code, we use the `np.var()` function from NumPy to calculate the sample variance. The `ddof=1` parameter specifies that we want to calculate the sample variance by dividing the sum of squared deviations by `(n - 1)`.
# Variance Calculation Examples

This Python script demonstrates how to calculate variance for different types of data using the `statistics` module. It includes examples for integers, floats, tuples, and custom objects.

## Examples Included

The script includes variance calculations for:

1. List of integers
2. List of floats
3. List of tuples (calculating variance of the first element)
4. List of custom objects (calculating variance of a specific attribute)

## Code Explanation

### 1. Integers
Calculates the variance of a list of integers.

### 2. Floats
Calculates the variance of a list of floating-point numbers.

### 3. Tuples
Extracts the first element from each tuple in a list and calculates the variance of these elements.

### 4. Custom Objects
Defines a simple `DataPoint` class with a `value` attribute. Creates a list of these objects, extracts the `value` from each, and calculates the variance.

## Output

The script will print the variance for each type of data:

- Variance of integers
- Variance of floats
- Variance of first elements of tuples
- Variance of object values

## Note

This script is for educational purposes to demonstrate how the `statistics.variance()` function can be used with different data types. In real-world applications, you might need to consider additional factors such as data size, precision requirements, and potential errors in data collection.

## 4. Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average deviation from the mean. It is expressed in the same units as the data points, making it easier to interpret than the variance.

**Formula for Population Standard Deviation:**
```
Standard Deviation(σ) = √(Σ(x_i - μ)² / N)
```

**Formula for Sample Standard Deviation:**
```
Standard Deviation(s) = √(Σ(x_i - x̄)² / (n - 1))
```

**Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
std_deviation = np.std(data, ddof=1)  # ddof=1 for sample standard deviation
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_deviation}")
```

**Explanation:**
For the given dataset `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the sample standard deviation is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the variance using the steps mentioned earlier: `Variance = 10`
2. Take the square root of the variance: `Standard Deviation = √10 ≈ 3.16`

In the Python code, we use the `np.std()` function from NumPy to calculate the sample standard deviation. The `ddof=1` parameter specifies that we want to calculate the sample standard deviation by taking the square root of the sample variance.

## Summary

Measures of variability are crucial for understanding the spread and distribution of data. They complement measures of central tendency by providing insights into the data's consistency and spread. The range and IQR provide simple measures of the total spread and the spread of the central values, respectively. The variance and standard deviation quantify the average deviation from the mean, with the standard deviation being more interpretable due to its use of the same units as the data.

Using Python and libraries like NumPy, these calculations are straightforward and efficient. By combining measures of central tendency and variability, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your dataset and make informed decisions based on its characteristics.

# Understanding the Normal Distribution in Statistics

## Introduction

The normal distribution, often referred to as the bell curve, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean. This means that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In real-life scenarios, many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution.

## Real-Life Examples

1. **Height of People**: Most people's heights cluster around the average height, with fewer people being extremely tall or extremely short.
2. **Test Scores**: Most students score around the average score, with fewer scoring very high or very low.
3. **Measurement Errors**: In scientific experiments, errors in measurements are usually normally distributed, with most errors being small and fewer errors being large.

## Key Properties of the Normal Distribution

1. **Symmetry**: The left half of the distribution is a mirror image of the right half.
2. **Mean, Median, and Mode**: These three measures of central tendency are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.
3. **68-95-99.7 Rule**: Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.

## Visualizing the Normal Distribution with Python

We'll use Python to visualize the normal distribution and understand its properties. The `numpy` library will be used to generate data and `matplotlib` for plotting.

### 1. Generating Normal Distribution Data

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate data
mean = 0
std_dev = 1
data = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, 1000)

# Plotting the histogram
plt.hist(data, bins=30, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Histogram of Normally Distributed Data')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

In this example, we generate 1000 random data points with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The histogram shows the distribution of these data points.

### 2. Visualizing the Probability Density Function (PDF)

```python
from scipy.stats import norm

# Generate x values
x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)
pdf = norm.pdf(x, mean, std_dev)

# Plotting the PDF
plt.plot(x, pdf, label='Normal Distribution', color='blue')
plt.title('Normal Distribution PDF')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code plots the probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution. The `scipy.stats` library provides convenient functions for working with statistical distributions.

### 3. The 68-95-99.7 Rule

```python
# Plotting the PDF with shaded areas for the 68-95-99.7 rule
plt.plot(x, pdf, label='Normal Distribution', color='blue')

# Shading the areas
for num_std in [1, 2, 3]:
    plt.fill_between(x, pdf, where=(x > mean - num_std * std_dev) & (x < mean + num_std * std_dev),
                     color='blue', alpha=0.2 * num_std, label=f'{num_std} std dev')

plt.title('Normal Distribution with 68-95-99.7 Rule')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This plot visualizes the areas within one, two, and three standard deviations from the mean, illustrating the 68-95-99.7 rule.

## Real-Life Example: Exam Scores

Consider a class of students who took a standardized test. The test scores are normally distributed with a mean score of 75 and a standard deviation of 10. Let's visualize this:

```python
# Generate data for exam scores
mean_exam = 75
std_dev_exam = 10
exam_scores = np.random.normal(mean_exam, std_dev_exam, 1000)

# Plotting the histogram of exam scores
plt.hist(exam_scores, bins=30, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Histogram of Exam Scores')
plt.xlabel('Score')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

By running this code, you can see how exam scores are distributed around the mean score of 75, with most scores falling within a certain range.

# Understanding the Binomial Distribution in Statistics

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent experiments, each with the same probability of success. This type of distribution is useful for scenarios where there are exactly two possible outcomes for each trial, often referred to as "success" and "failure".

## Key Properties of the Binomial Distribution

1. **Number of Trials (n)**: The fixed number of experiments or trials.
2. **Probability of Success (p)**: The probability of a success on an individual trial.
3. **Number of Successes (k)**: The number of successes in the n trials.

## The Binomial Formula

The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by:

P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
* (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials.
* p is the probability of success.
* (1-p) is the probability of failure.

## Real-Life Examples

1. **Flipping a Coin**: If you flip a fair coin 10 times, what is the probability of getting exactly 6 heads?
2. **Quality Control**: In a batch of 100 products, where each product has a 5% chance of being defective, what is the probability of finding exactly 2 defective products?

## Visualizing the Binomial Distribution with Python

Let's use Python to visualize the binomial distribution and understand its properties. We'll use the `numpy` library to generate data and `matplotlib` for plotting.

### Example 1: Coin Flipping

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import binom

# Parameters for the binomial distribution
n = 10  # Number of trials
p = 0.5  # Probability of success (getting a head)

# Generate binomial distribution data
x = np.arange(0, n + 1)
binomial_pmf = binom.pmf(x, n, p)

# Plotting the binomial distribution
plt.bar(x, binomial_pmf, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Binomial Distribution (n=10, p=0.5)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Heads')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Quality Control

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import binom

# Parameters for the binomial distribution
n = 100  # Number of products
p = 0.05  # Probability of a product being defective

# Generate binomial distribution data
x = np.arange(0, 11)  # We consider up to 10 defective products for visualization
binomial_pmf = binom.pmf(x, n, p)

# Plotting the binomial distribution
plt.bar(x, binomial_pmf, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Binomial Distribution (n=100, p=0.05)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Defective Products')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```
# Binomial Distribution Examples

This repository contains Python scripts to demonstrate and visualize the binomial distribution using two real-life examples: coin flipping and quality control in manufacturing.

## 1. Coin Flipping

### Scenario:
We want to understand the binomial distribution when flipping a fair coin 10 times.

### Parameters:
- **Number of Trials (n)**: 10 (flips of the coin)
- **Probability of Success (p)**: 0.5 (probability of getting heads)

### Visualization:
![Binomial Distribution (n=10, p=0.5)](coin_flipping_binomial.png)

#### Interpretation:
The graph shows the probability of getting a specific number of heads (0 to 10) when flipping a fair coin 10 times. As expected with a fair coin, the most likely outcome is 5 heads, with probabilities decreasing symmetrically towards 0 and 10 heads.

## 2. Quality Control

### Scenario:
We want to simulate the binomial distribution in quality control, where we inspect 100 products and each has a 5% chance of being defective.

### Parameters:
- **Number of Trials (n)**: 100 (products inspected)
- **Probability of Success (p)**: 0.05 (probability of a product being defective)

### Visualization:
![Binomial Distribution (n=100, p=0.05)](quality_control_binomial.png)

#### Interpretation:
The graph illustrates the probability of finding a specific number of defective products (0 to 10) in a batch of 100 products. With a low probability of each product being defective (5%), the most likely outcome is finding around 5 defective products. The probability decreases as the number of defective products deviates from this average.

## Summary

The binomial distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics with numerous real-life applications. Understanding its properties and visualizing it with Python can provide valuable insights into data analysis and interpretation.

# Understanding the Poisson Distribution in Statistics

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space. These events must occur independently of each other, and the average rate (mean number of events per interval) must be constant.

## Key Properties of the Poisson Distribution

1. **λ (lambda)**: The average rate (mean) of occurrences within a fixed interval.
2. **k**: The actual number of events that occur in a fixed interval.

## The Poisson Formula

The probability of observing k events in an interval is given by:

P(X=k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!

Where:
* λ is the average rate of events per interval.
* e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828).
* k! is the factorial of k.

## Real-Life Examples

1. **Number of Emails Received**: If you receive an average of 5 emails per hour, the Poisson distribution can model the probability of receiving a certain number of emails in the next hour.

2. **Number of Phone Calls**: If a call center receives an average of 10 calls per hour, the Poisson distribution can model the probability of receiving a specific number of calls in an hour.

## Visualizing the Poisson Distribution with Python

Let's use Python to visualize the Poisson distribution and understand its properties using the examples above.

### Example 1: Number of Emails Received

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Parameters for the Poisson distribution
lambda_email = 5  # Average number of emails per hour

# Generate Poisson distribution data
k_values = np.arange(0, 15)
poisson_pmf = poisson.pmf(k_values, lambda_email)

# Plotting the Poisson distribution
plt.bar(k_values, poisson_pmf, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Poisson Distribution (lambda=5)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Emails')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Number of Phone Calls

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Parameters for the Poisson distribution
lambda_calls = 10  # Average number of calls per hour

# Generate Poisson distribution data
k_values = np.arange(0, 21)
poisson_pmf = poisson.pmf(k_values, lambda_calls)

# Plotting the Poisson distribution
plt.bar(k_values, poisson_pmf, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Poisson Distribution (lambda=10)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Phone Calls')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

# Understanding the Bernoulli Distribution in Statistics

The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest discrete probability distribution, representing a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0). This distribution is a building block for other distributions, like the binomial distribution.

## Key Properties of the Bernoulli Distribution

1. **p**: The probability of success in a single trial.
2. **1-p**: The probability of failure in a single trial.

## The Bernoulli Formula

The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution is given by:

P(X=x) = p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)

Where:
* x can be either 0 (failure) or 1 (success).
* p is the probability of success.

## Real-Life Examples

1. **Coin Toss**: The outcome of flipping a coin (heads or tails) can be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution.
2. **Quality Control**: Checking if a product is defective (defective or not defective).

## Visualizing the Bernoulli Distribution with Python

Let's use Python to visualize the Bernoulli distribution and understand its properties using the examples above.

### Example 1: Coin Toss

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import bernoulli

# Parameters for the Bernoulli distribution
p_coin = 0.5  # Probability of getting heads

# Generate Bernoulli distribution data
x = np.array([0, 1])
pmf_coin = bernoulli.pmf(x, p_coin)

# Plotting the Bernoulli distribution
plt.bar(x, pmf_coin, width=0.1, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.xticks([0, 1], ['Tails (0)', 'Heads (1)'])
plt.title('Bernoulli Distribution (p=0.5)')
plt.xlabel('Outcome')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Quality Control

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import bernoulli

# Parameters for the Bernoulli distribution
p_defective = 0.1  # Probability of a product being defective

# Generate Bernoulli distribution data
x = np.array([0, 1])
pmf_defective = bernoulli.pmf(x, p_defective)

# Plotting the Bernoulli distribution
plt.bar(x, pmf_defective, width=0.1, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.xticks([0, 1], ['Not Defective (0)', 'Defective (1)'])
plt.title('Bernoulli Distribution (p=0.1)')
plt.xlabel('Outcome')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

# Understanding p-value in Statistical Hypothesis Testing

## Overview

The p-value is a crucial concept in statistical hypothesis testing. It helps determine the significance of results from a statistical test by indicating the probability of obtaining an effect at least as extreme as the one observed in the data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In simpler terms, it tells us how likely it is that the results we are seeing are due to random chance.

# Statistical Hypothesis Testing Examples

This repository demonstrates examples of statistical hypothesis testing using Python in various scenarios:

## Example 1: Medical Treatment Effectiveness

**Scenario:** A pharmaceutical company tests a new drug to treat a disease.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The new drug has no effect.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The new drug has a significant effect.

**Interpretation:**
After conducting a statistical test (e.g., t-test), if the p-value is less than a significance level (typically 0.05), it indicates that the observed improvement in patient conditions is unlikely due to chance. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected, suggesting that the drug has a significant effect.

## Example 2: Marketing Campaign Success

**Scenario:** A marketing team evaluates the impact of a new advertising campaign on sales.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The campaign has no impact on sales.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The campaign significantly increases sales.

**Interpretation:**
By analyzing sales data before and after the campaign using statistical tests (e.g., paired t-test), a p-value less than 0.05 suggests that the observed increase in sales is unlikely due to random chance. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that the campaign had a significant impact on sales.

## Additional Examples

### Example 3: Educational Intervention

**Scenario:** Testing the effectiveness of an educational intervention on test scores.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The intervention has no effect on test scores.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The intervention improves test scores significantly.

**Interpretation:**
After analyzing test score data using appropriate statistical tests, a low p-value would suggest that the intervention significantly improved test scores, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.

### Example 4: Website Redesign Impact

**Scenario:** Assessing the impact of a website redesign on user engagement metrics.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The website redesign has no impact on user engagement.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The website redesign improves user engagement significantly.

**Interpretation:**
Through statistical tests analyzing engagement metrics before and after the redesign, a p-value less than 0.05 would indicate that the redesign led to a significant improvement in user engagement, thus rejecting the null hypothesis.


## Key Points to Remember

- **Interpretation**: A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, favoring the alternative hypothesis.
- **Not Absolute Proof**: A low p-value does not prove that the alternative hypothesis is true or that the effect is practically significant. It only suggests that the observed results are unlikely to be due to random chance.
- **Context Matters**: The interpretation of p-values depends on the specific hypothesis being tested and the context of the study.

## Conclusion

By understanding p-values and how they are used in real-world scenarios, you can better interpret the results of statistical analyses and make informed decisions based on data.

# Understanding Correlation in Python

## Introduction

Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. It is an essential concept in data analysis, helping us understand relationships and dependencies between variables. This guide will introduce you to correlation and walk you through a Python example demonstrating how to calculate and visualize correlations using various libraries.

## What is Correlation?

Correlation quantifies the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is a common measure of linear correlation, ranging from -1 to 1:
- **1**: Perfect positive correlation.
- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation.
- **0**: No linear correlation.

## Example: Correlation in Python

### Libraries Used
- `numpy`: For generating random data.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and correlation matrix calculation.
- `matplotlib`: For creating scatter plots.
- `seaborn`: For visualizing the correlation matrix as a heatmap.
- `scipy`: For calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.

### Example Scenario

We will analyze the relationships between the following variables:
- **Study Hours**: Hours spent studying per day.
- **Exam Scores**: Exam scores out of 100.
- **Social Media Hours**: Hours spent on social media per day.
- **Coffee Consumption**: Cups of coffee consumed per day.

### Code Explanation

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# 1. Creating example data
n = 50
study_hours = np.random.uniform(1, 5, n)  # Hours spent studying per day
exam_scores = 60 + 8 * study_hours + np.random.normal(0, 5, n)  # Exam scores (0-100)
social_media_hours = 4 - 0.5 * study_hours + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, n)  # Hours spent on social media
coffee_consumption = np.random.uniform(0, 5, n)  # Cups of coffee per day

# 2. Calculating Pearson correlation
corr_study_exam = stats.pearsonr(study_hours, exam_scores)
corr_study_social = stats.pearsonr(study_hours, social_media_hours)
corr_coffee_exam = stats.pearsonr(coffee_consumption, exam_scores)

print("Correlation between study hours and exam scores:", corr_study_exam)
print("Correlation between study hours and social media usage:", corr_study_social)
print("Correlation between coffee consumption and exam scores:", corr_coffee_exam)

# 3. Visualizing correlations
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

ax1.scatter(study_hours, exam_scores)
ax1.set_title(f'Study Hours vs Exam Scores (r={corr_study_exam[0]:.2f})')
ax1.set_xlabel('Study Hours')
ax1.set_ylabel('Exam Scores')

ax2.scatter(study_hours, social_media_hours)
ax2.set_title(f'Study Hours vs Social Media Usage (r={corr_study_social[0]:.2f})')
ax2.set_xlabel('Study Hours')
ax2.set_ylabel('Social Media Hours')

ax3.scatter(coffee_consumption, exam_scores)
ax3.set_title(f'Coffee Consumption vs Exam Scores (r={corr_coffee_exam[0]:.2f})')
ax3.set_xlabel('Coffee Cups per Day')
ax3.set_ylabel('Exam Scores')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('correlation_plots.png')
plt.close()

# 4. Using pandas for correlation
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Study Hours': study_hours,
    'Exam Scores': exam_scores,
    'Social Media Hours': social_media_hours,
    'Coffee Consumption': coffee_consumption
})
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

print("\nCorrelation Matrix:")
print(correlation_matrix)

# 5. Visualizing correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', vmin=-1, vmax=1, center=0)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.savefig('correlation_heatmap.png')
plt.close()
```

### Steps Explained

1. **Creating Example Data**:
   - `study_hours`: Random data representing hours spent studying per day.
   - `exam_scores`: Generated based on study hours with some added noise.
   - `social_media_hours`: Inversely related to study hours with some added noise.
   - `coffee_consumption`: Random data representing cups of coffee consumed per day.

2. **Calculating Pearson Correlation**:
   - Use `stats.pearsonr` to calculate the correlation coefficient and p-value between pairs of variables:
     - Study hours and exam scores.
     - Study hours and social media usage.
     - Coffee consumption and exam scores.

3. **Visualizing Correlations**:
   - Create scatter plots to visualize the relationships between the variables:
     - Study hours vs exam scores.
     - Study hours vs social media usage.
     - Coffee consumption vs exam scores.

4. **Using `pandas` for Correlation**:
   - Create a DataFrame and compute the correlation matrix to see all pairwise correlations.

5. **Visualizing Correlation Matrix**:
   - Use `seaborn` to create a heatmap of the correlation matrix for a clear visualization of the correlations between variables.

### Interpretation of Results

1. **Correlation between Study Hours and Exam Scores**:
   - High positive correlation indicates that more study hours are associated with higher exam scores.

2. **Correlation between Study Hours and Social Media Usage**:
   - High negative correlation suggests that more study hours are associated with less social media usage.

3. **Correlation between Coffee Consumption and Exam Scores**:
   - Low correlation suggests no significant relationship between coffee consumption and exam scores.

4. **Correlation Matrix**:
   - Displays all pairwise correlation coefficients.

5. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - Visual representation of the correlation matrix, making it easy to identify strong and weak correlations.

This guide introduces you to the basics of correlation and demonstrates how to calculate and visualize correlations in Python using real-world-like data. Adjust the code and data to explore correlations in your specific use cases.

# Pearson's Chi-Square Test in Python

This README provides a beginner-friendly guide to understanding and performing Pearson's Chi-Square Test in Python with a real-life example.

## What is Pearson's Chi-Square Test?

Pearson's Chi-Square Test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It's often used in hypothesis testing.

There are two main types of Chi-Square Tests:
1. **Chi-Square Test for Independence**: Tests whether two categorical variables are independent.
2. **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test**: Tests whether an observed frequency distribution differs from a theoretical distribution.

This guide focuses on the **Chi-Square Test for Independence**.

## Real-Life Example: Customer Satisfaction

We'll use a hypothetical customer satisfaction survey to demonstrate the test. The goal is to determine if there's an association between gender and satisfaction level.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### 2. Creating Example Data

```python
data = {
    'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female'],
    'Satisfaction': ['Satisfied', 'Satisfied', 'Neutral', 'Dissatisfied', 'Dissatisfied', 'Neutral', 'Satisfied', 'Dissatisfied']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### 3. Creating a Contingency Table

```python
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['Gender'], df['Satisfaction'])
print(contingency_table)
```

### 4. Performing the Chi-Square Test

```python
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
print(f"Chi-Square Statistic: {chi2}")
print(f"P-Value: {p}")
print(f"Degrees of Freedom: {dof}")
print(f"Expected Frequencies: \n{expected}")
```

### 5. Interpreting the Results

* **Chi-Square Statistic**: Indicates the difference between observed and expected frequencies.
* **P-Value**: Tells us whether the observed difference is statistically significant. A common threshold is 0.05.
* **Degrees of Freedom (dof)**: Number of independent values or quantities which can be assigned to a statistical distribution.
* **Expected Frequencies**: The frequency of occurrences we would expect if the null hypothesis were true.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between the variables.

### 6. Visualizing the Data

```python
sns.countplot(data=df, x='Satisfaction', hue='Gender')
plt.title('Customer Satisfaction by Gender')
plt.xlabel('Satisfaction Level')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

This visualization provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between the variables.

# README: Understanding Pearson’s Chi-Square Test in Python

## Introduction

Pearson’s Chi-Square Test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. This README will guide you through understanding and interpreting the results of a Chi-Square Test using a real-life example involving customer satisfaction and gender.

## Real-Life Example: Customer Satisfaction by Gender

### Example Data

In this example, we have survey data from customers about their satisfaction with a product, categorized by gender (Male and Female) and satisfaction level (Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied).

### Python Code Explanation

The provided Python code performs the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**: Necessary libraries for data manipulation, statistical testing, and visualization are imported.
2. **Create Example Data**: A DataFrame is created with categorical data for gender and satisfaction level.
3. **Create a Contingency Table**: A contingency table (cross-tabulation) is generated to show the frequency distribution of gender and satisfaction.
4. **Perform the Chi-Square Test**: The `chi2_contingency` function from `scipy.stats` is used to calculate the Chi-Square statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, and expected frequencies.
5. **Interpret Results**: The results of the Chi-Square Test are interpreted to determine if there is a significant association between gender and satisfaction.
6. **Visualize the Data**: A count plot is created to visualize the distribution of satisfaction levels by gender.

### Results and Interpretation

1. **Contingency Table**:
    ```
    Contingency Table:
    Satisfaction  Dissatisfied  Neutral  Satisfied
    Gender                                       
    Female                   2        1          1
    Male                     1        1          2
    ```

    This table shows the frequency of each satisfaction level for male and female respondents.

2. **Chi-Square Test Results**:
    ```
    Chi-Square Statistic: 0.6666666666666666
    P-Value: 0.7165313105737893
    Degrees of Freedom: 2
    Expected Frequencies: 
    [[1.5 1.  1.5]
     [1.5 1.  1.5]]
    ```

    - **Chi-Square Statistic**: 0.67
    - **P-Value**: 0.72
    - **Degrees of Freedom**: 2
    - **Expected Frequencies**: 
        ```
        [[1.5 1.0 1.5]
         [1.5 1.0 1.5]]
        ```

    The expected frequencies are the frequencies we would expect if there were no association between gender and satisfaction level.

3. **Interpreting the Results**:

    Since the p-value (0.72) is greater than the common significance level (0.05), we do not reject the null hypothesis. This means there is no statistically significant association between gender and satisfaction level.

    ```
    There is no significant association between gender and satisfaction level.
    ```

4. **Visualizing the Data**:

    The count plot visualizes the distribution of satisfaction levels by gender.

    ![Customer Satisfaction by Gender](correlation_plots.png)

### Conclusion

In this example, we performed Pearson’s Chi-Square Test for Independence to determine whether there is a significant association between gender and satisfaction level. The results indicated no significant association, meaning that satisfaction levels do not significantly differ between males and females in our sample data.

This guide should help you understand and perform Pearson’s Chi-Square Test in Python using real-life data. Adjust the data and parameters as needed to fit your specific use case.
