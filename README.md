 # Installing and Running Jupyter Book

This guide provides instructions on how to install Jupyter Book, create a new book, and run Jupyter Notebooks within it. You will also learn how to execute notebook cells using `Shift + Enter`.

## Table of Contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Creating a New Jupyter Book](#creating-a-new-jupyter-book)
- [Building the Book](#building-the-book)
- [Running Jupyter Notebooks](#running-jupyter-notebooks)
  - [Starting Jupyter Notebook](#starting-jupyter-notebook)
  - [Executing Cells](#executing-cells)
- [Further Resources](#further-resources)

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

To install Jupyter Book, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U jupyter-book
```

## Creating a New Jupyter Book

After installing Jupyter Book, you can create a new book by running:

```bash
jupyter-book create mynewbook
```

This command will create a directory named `mynewbook` with the default book structure.

## Building the Book

Navigate to your book directory and build the book using the following commands:

```bash
cd mynewbook
jupyter-book build .
```

The `jupyter-book build .` command will generate the static HTML files for your book in the `_build/html` directory.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks

### Starting Jupyter Notebook

To interactively run Jupyter Notebooks, start the Jupyter Notebook server. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your book and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

### Executing Cells

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can create or open a notebook (`.ipynb` file). Each notebook consists of cells, which can contain code, text, or other content. 

To execute the code in a cell:

1. Click on the cell to select it.
2. Press `Shift + Enter`.

This will run the code in the selected cell and move the cursor to the next cell.

## Further Resources

For more detailed information on Jupyter Book and Jupyter Notebooks, refer to the following resources:

- [Jupyter Book Documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

These resources provide comprehensive instructions and examples to help you leverage the full capabilities of Jupyter Book and Jupyter Notebooks.
